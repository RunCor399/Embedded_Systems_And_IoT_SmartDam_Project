The Smart Dam system consists of five subsystems coordinated with each other to
manage the status of a dam according to the water level detected by a special
sensor.
The five components of the system are as follows:


1. ***Remote Hydrometer***: A sensor that is responsible for detecting the level
of water in a river and communicating it to other subsystems.

2. ***Dam Service***: Fundamental to the management of the system, it is responsible for
the propagation of information to different components.

3. ***Dam Controller***: Apparatus that operates the mechanism for opening and
closure of the dam in relation to the information received from Dam Service, it is
also deals with sending and receiving data from/to Dam Mobile.

4. ***Dam Mobile***: Mobile application that allows an operator to.
view various information about the dam and possibly change its
status.

5. ***Dam Dashboard***: Web interface that allows a user to
view data
